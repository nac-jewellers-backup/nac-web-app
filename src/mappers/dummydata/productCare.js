        Toothpaste can be used as a cleansing agent but it is advisable to use
        gentler washing fluids instead. Soak your jewellery in warm water for
        two minutes and then gently clean it with a soft cloth. Rinse and dry
        for the final touch.
      </div>,
      "Ammonia is another alternative but it's best to use it only occasionally as it is a strong cleaning agent. Mix four parts of warm water and one part of household ammonia, submerge the ornaments for not more than ten minutes before rinsing and drying them.",

        Gold Jewellery with gemstones should not be brushed hard or rubbed
        repeatedly as this may loosen the gemstones. Clean it with a soft cloth
        dipped in a solution of mild dish detergent and warm water instead.

      <div style={{ marginTop: "25px", marginBottom: "25px" }}>
        Another alternative is to buff the jewellery with a soft cloth after
        washing it in a bowl of lukewarm water to. Add a few drops of
        dishwashing liquid to help remove tarnishing.
      </div>,
      "For heavier tarnish, make a paste with three parts baking soda to one part water. Wet the silver and apply the paste with a soft cloth. Rinse with cool water and buff with a until dry. Do not soak silver as this speeds up the tarnishing process.",

        Prompt cleaning is important when silver has been exposed to certain
        food containing sulphur or those thatare acidic. Food such are salt,
        eggs, onions, mayonnaise and vinegar are harmful to silver.

        Just as with gold, simply soak the jewellery in water with mild
        detergent and then rub off the dirt, grime and even the fingerprints
        which eat away the natural shine. Rinse and dry to get the original
        sparkle back on your platinum jewellery.

      <div style={{ marginTop: "25px", marginBottom: "25px" }}>
        A simple buff with a soft cloth after a mild soap wash can actually
        bring the lustre back. It is also recommended that you don’t expose it
        to any kind of chemicals or oil for a long time.

      <div style={{ marginTop: "25px", marginBottom: "25px" }}>
        Asimple soapy wash followed by a pat dray and a soft cloth buff should
        do the trick.

        A few commercial cleaning solutions or household gentle washes can also
        be used. However, we recommended staying clear of harsher chemicals such
        as abrasive household cleaners.
