            "Ours is a journey that began almost hundred years ago in 1917, when Shri Nathella Narayana Chetty started a small jewellery business at home where he fashioned hand-made jewels for a few loyal patrons. His son, Shri Nathella Anantham Chetty opened a small store in Parry’s Corner in old Madras, which soon became a flourishing business. His son, Shri N. Anjaneyulu Chetty, founded NAC Jewellers and nourished its brand along with his son Shri Anantha Padmanabhan who transformed the small store into a chain of jewellery houses. Today, Anand Ramanujam, the fifth generation of scion of this illustrious family, continues the legacy of his forefathers.<br ></br>We are known for our unique and rare designs, as we are ever mindful about the latest trends in jewellery and the expectations of the customer. We also export jewellery abroad, we cater to the growing market of Indian ethnic jewellery.",

The term itself is derived from the Carob fruit, whose evenly weighted seeds were used long ago as a comparative measurement for the weighing of diamonds and other small, but valuable, items. Contrary to popular belief, carat weight is not directly correlated to the size or a diamond. One carat is equal to 0.20 grams, and is subdivided into 100 points. Larger diamonds are rarer than small diamonds, which means that each subsequent carat of weight makes a diamond successively more expensive with the value per carat increasing with the size of the diamond. An obvious example for this is that 0.50 carat diamonds are worth less than a single 1 carat diamond due to the natural rarity of larger rough diamonds.
